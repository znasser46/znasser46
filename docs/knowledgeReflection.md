# Architecture
### User Story:
* As a web developer I want to create a website to effectively show my skills and projects so that people dont have to search for them seperately.

WorkFLow:
* Follows agile processes
  * Seperated tasks using issues
  * Frequently updated code in iterations
* Wireframes created to layout design idea
* VS code is used to code locally with live server
* Github is used for deployment
* Web sources are used frequently for libraries
